## Keypad library for Arduino

This repository is a copy of the code found here [[Arduino Playground]](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad).

However, this version has been modified so that the row pins are analogue,
thus allowing the usage of all the analogue pins on the Arduino Nano, and
therefore more keys in your matrix.
